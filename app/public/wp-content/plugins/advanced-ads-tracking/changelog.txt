Tracking 2.0 is a major release. The various fixes and improvements can lead to changes in recorded impressions and clicks. See https://wpadvancedads.com/tracking-2-0/ for more details.

Major changes:

- the "On load" method is now called Database
- the "After page loaded" method was removed
- click tracking works on JavaScript-based ads and iframes
- target URLs in custom HTML code no longer need to be defined to being tracked
- cloak individual target URLs
- all Tracking methods work on AMP pages without requiring the Responsive add-on
- more bots are filtered out
